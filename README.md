Hi there 👋 I'm Erick

🎮 In a previous life I was game producer  that worked at:

- [Activision](https://www.activision.com)
- [Atari](https://atari.com)
- [THQ](https://www.thqnordic.com)

🤝 I've recently started working with Laurence at [extropy.io](https://github.com/ExtropyIO) and I couldn't be happier about it.


🦀 Diving into the world of Rust, exploring its intricacies and honing my skills, I sometimes write about it [here](https://desmodrone.github.io).


📸 I fuel my creative side with my content agency [apexwins.com](https://www.apexwins.com). 

⚡️ Fun fact: The inspiration behind my username actually comes from the desmodromic valve timing system utilized in Ducati motorcycles.
