Hi there 👋 I'm Erick

🎮 In a previous life I was game producer  that worked at:

- [Activision](https://www.activision.com)
- [Atari](https://atari.com)
- [THQ](https://www.thqnordic.com)

🦀 Currently diving into the world of Rust, exploring its intricacies and honing my skills, I sometimes write about it [here](https://desmodrone.github.io).

🤝 I've recently started collaborating with Amos at [bearcove](https://github.com/bearcove) and it's super exciting.

📸 I fuel my creative side with my content agency [apexwins.com](www.apexwins.com). 

⚡️ random fact: my username is derived from the desmodromic valve timing system used in Ducati motorcycle's
